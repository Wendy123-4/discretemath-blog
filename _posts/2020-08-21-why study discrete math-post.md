# Discrete Mathematics is everywhere!

It's often said that mathematics is useful in solving a very wide variety of practical problems.
You may not have noticed but more of the math being done in both academia and industry and even our day-to-day life is discrete.

I bet you are eager to know where exactly it applies in the real world so let's jump to thatðŸ˜‰

## Google Maps

Google Maps uses discrete mathematics to determine fastest driving routes and times.
There is a simpler version that works with small maps and technicalities involved in adapting to large maps.

## Scheduling
Scheduling problems---like deciding which nurses should work which shifts, or which airline pilots should be flying which routes, 
or scheduling rooms for an event, or deciding timeslots for committee meetings, 
or which chemicals can be stored in which parts of a warehouse---are solved either using graph coloring or using combinatorial optimization, both parts of discrete mathematics. One example is scheduling games for a professional sports league.

## Networks
Networks are, at base, discrete structures. The routers that run the internet are connected by long cables. 
People are connected to each other by social media ("following" on Twitter, "friending" on Facebook, etc.). The US highway system connects cities with roads.



Honestly the list goes on and on.
It's applied in web searches, wiring a computer network, cell phone communication, digital image processing and many others.
Discrete math is ##fun!
Be openminded and eager to learn
