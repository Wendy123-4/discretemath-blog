# What is Computer Science?

When you mention Computer Science, usually the assumptions that follow are "a course for geeks", "it is difficult", "it's all about coding".

Let's start off by debunking the assumptions.
All you need to study computer science is discipline and the zeal to learn everyday.
This field is constantly changing so it is up to you to update your knowledge even after the course.
And for difficulty, which course is easy!

## Now, the facts
Computer Science is the study of computer technology, both hardware and software.
However, computer science is a diverse field; the required skills are both applicable and in-demand across practically every industry in today's technology-dependent world.
The field of computer science spans several core areas: computer theory, hardware systems, software systems, and scientific computing. 

Though most strict specialization occurs at the graduate level, knowing exactly what computer science is (and where a student's interests fall within this vast field) is of paramount importance to knowing how to study computer science.

Despite the seemingly endless variety of applications and sub-disciplines, asking important questions like, "What is computer science?" is a great way to begin a successful education and, ultimately, career.
